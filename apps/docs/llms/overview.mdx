SpinAI supports multiple LLMs for agent decision making:

- [OpenAI](/llms/openai)
- [Anthropic](/llms/anthropic)
- [Gemini](/llms/gemini)

Each LLM can be configured with custom settings like:

- Model selection
- Temperature
- Token limits
- API configuration

## Choosing an LLM

Consider these factors when choosing an LLM:

- Cost per token
- Response quality
- API reliability
- Token context limits

## Gemini Model

The Gemini model, powered by Google Generative AI, offers a unique blend of speed and accuracy for generating content. It can be tailored to specific needs through model selection and custom configuration options such as temperature and token limits. For detailed setup instructions, refer to the [Gemini Setup](/llms/gemini) documentation.
