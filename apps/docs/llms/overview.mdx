SpinAI supports multiple LLMs for agent decision making:

- [OpenAI](/llms/openai)
- [Anthropic](/llms/anthropic)
- [Gemini](/llms/gemini)

Each LLM can be configured with custom settings like:

- Model selection
- Temperature
- Token limits
- API configuration

## Choosing an LLM

Consider these factors when choosing an LLM:

- Cost per token
- Response quality
- API reliability
- Token context limits

In addition to the above, the Gemini model offers unique advantages in terms of adaptability and efficiency, making it a compelling option for specific use cases.
