SpinAI now supports a wider range of LLMs for agent decision making, providing more flexibility and options for integration:

- [OpenAI](/llms/openai)
- [Anthropic](/llms/anthropic)
- [Cloudflare](/llms/cloudflare) {/* New */}
- [Custom HTTP](/llms/custom-http) {/* New */}

Each LLM can be configured with custom settings to best suit your needs, including:

- Model selection
- Temperature
- Token limits
- API configuration

## Choosing an LLM

When selecting an LLM for your application, consider the following factors:

- Cost per token
- Response quality
- API reliability
- Token context limits

These factors can help you determine which LLM offers the best value and performance for your specific use case.

## New Integrations

### Cloudflare

The Cloudflare integration allows you to leverage Cloudflare's distributed network for faster and more reliable LLM requests. This is particularly beneficial for applications requiring high availability and low latency.

### Custom HTTP

For ultimate flexibility, the Custom HTTP integration enables you to connect any LLM that offers an HTTP API. This option is ideal for businesses with unique requirements or those looking to integrate proprietary language models.
