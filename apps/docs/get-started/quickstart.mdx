## Create a New Project

Use our CLI to create a new SpinAI project:

```bash
npx create-spinai
```

## Configure Environment

Create a `.env` file in your project root. You can now choose between using OpenAI or the new Gemini model for your AI agent. For Gemini, you'll need a Google Generative AI API key:

```bash
# For OpenAI
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

# For Gemini
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
```

## Update Agent Configuration

Depending on your choice of AI model, update your agent's configuration to use either OpenAI or Gemini. Here's how you can set up your agent to use the Gemini model:

```typescript
import { createGeminiLLM } from '@your_project/spinai/llms/gemini';

const geminiConfig = {
  apiKey: process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY,
  model: 'gemini-2.0-flash', // Optional: specify the Gemini model version
};

const geminiAgent = createGeminiLLM(geminiConfig);
```

Ensure this configuration is applied where your agent is initialized.

## Run Your Agent

Start your agent:

```bash
npm run dev
```

That's it! Your agent will now:

1. Receive the user's question.
2. Decide to use the configured action (e.g., getWeather for OpenAI or a custom action for Gemini).
3. Execute the action.
4. Provide a response.
